# Fashion-MNIST Neural Network
## Introduction
This project aims to create a neural network for classifying data based on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The goal is to achieve an accuracy level above 90%.

## Steps
1. **Implementing Neural Network:** The first step involves implementing a neural network on the Fashion-MNIST dataset to achieve a test accuracy of greater than 90%.
2. **Model Saving and Interface Development:** The second step is to save and provide the model, along with writing an interface that takes input values and returns the predicted value by our model along with the drawn input image (to visually verify its functionality).
3. **Accuracy Improvement through Augmentation:**  The third step is to improve our accuracy by using augmentation techniques, i.e., creating new data based on existing data using libraries such as Albumentation and OpenCV.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language for implementing neural network models.
- **Numpy:** Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib:** Library for creating plots and visualizing data.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Library for machine learning models and tools.
- **TensorFlow:** Open-source machine learning framework for building and training neural networks.
- **Keras:** High-level neural networks API, compatible with TensorFlow.
- **Albumentations:** Library for data augmentation.
- **OpenCV:** Library for image processing.
